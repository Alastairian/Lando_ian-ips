# IAI-IPS: A Dual-Core Cognitive Architecture for AGI

This repository implements a prototype of the Instinctive and Analytical Intelligence Problem Solving (IAI-IPS) system, as described in the research by Alastair Ian S. Tinio.

## Core Concepts

- **Dialectical Principle:** Models subjects as a dynamic interplay of opposing aspects and contradictions.
- **Cognitive Unit:** A 10-layer neural network whose internal structure is dynamically controlled.
- **Twine Cognition:** Dual-core architecture (Logos for analytical, Pathos for intuitive) in constant feedback.

## Directory Structure

- `/core`: Base cognitive unit, core node, dialectical processing.
- `/twine`: Logos and Pathos cores, feedback loop.
- `/learning`: Four learning modes (deeper, generalized, historical, predictive).
- `/simulation`: Scenario-based testing.

## Next Steps

- Implement core logic for contradiction modeling.
- Design feedback loop between Logos and Pathos.
- Integrate four learning modes.
- Simulate complex scenarios and analyze dynamic resource allocation.
