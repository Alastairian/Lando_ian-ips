# IAI-IPS: Twine Cognition Python Prototype

This is a prototype implementation of the IAI-IPS dual-core cognitive architecture described by Alastair Ian S. Tinio.

## Structure

- `core/` – Cognitive units, dialectical logic utilities
- `twine/` – Logos and Pathos cores, feedback loop

## How to Use

- Expand the `process()` methods to implement the learning modes and feedback mechanisms described in the paper.
- Start with simple toy problems (e.g., classifying structured/chaotic data) to validate architecture dynamics.

## Next Steps

- Implement contradiction logic and dynamic layer adjustment.
- Create basic crisis scenario simulations.
- Develop feedback signaling between Pathos and Logos.
